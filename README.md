## 1. Project Overview
This project explores and compares the historical stock price trends of prominent companies listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India ‚Äî including **CIPLA**, **Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)**, **Reliance Industries**, and **HDFC Ltd**.

The goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and insights through data analysis and visualization, using daily stock prices over several years. This is a beginner-friendly finance project built following the six-step data analysis process.

---

## 2. Objective.
To analyze stock trends, daily returns, volatility, and comparative performance of selected Indian companies from 2000 to 2021 in order to develop a foundational understanding of financial data and long-term investing behavior.

---

## 3. Key Questions (ASK Phase)

1. Which company among CIPLA, RELIANCE, HDFC, and TCS delivered the most consistent returns from 2000 to 2021, based on annualized return and standard deviation?  
2. How did each company‚Äôs 30-day moving average behave during major market stress periods (e.g., 2008 crisis, 2016 demonetization, 2020 COVID crash)?  
3. What was the maximum drawdown for each stock between 2000 and 2021, and how long did it take to recover?  
4. How does the average monthly return and volatility of each company compare, and what does this imply about risk-reward trade-offs?  
5. Which company offered the best risk-adjusted return (Sharpe Ratio) over the two decades?

## 13. Conclusion

This project applied a data-driven approach to analyze the long-term performance of four major Indian stocks ‚Äî CIPLA, HDFC, RELIANCE, and TCS ‚Äî from 2000 to 2021. Through five SMART questions, we explored consistency, volatility, crisis behavior, downside risk, and risk-adjusted returns.

### üèÜ Final Rankings (Overall Score Summary)

| Rank | Company   | Investor Profile                        |
|------|-----------|------------------------------------------|
| ü•á 1 | **HDFC**      | Growth-Oriented (High return, high risk) |
| ü•à 2 | **RELIANCE**  | Balanced (Moderate risk and return)      |
| ü•â 3 | **TCS**       | Conservative (Low volatility, stable gains) |
| üö© 4 | **CIPLA**     | Speculative (Low return, high risk)      |

HDFC stood out as a top performer with the highest return and Sharpe Ratio but at the cost of high volatility. TCS delivered consistent, stable results ideal for conservative investors, while RELIANCE balanced both well. CIPLA lagged in return and recovery, making it the riskiest pick.

This analysis highlights how historical price behavior and risk-adjusted metrics can guide more informed investment decisions.
